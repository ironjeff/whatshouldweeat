Success! Created WhatShouldWeEat at /Users/jeffhuang/Documents/Projects/WhatShouldWeEat
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server so you can open your app in the Expo
    app on your phone.

  npm run ios
    (Mac only, requires Xcode)
    Starts the development server and loads your app in an iOS simulator.

  npm run android
    (Requires Android build tools)
    Starts the development server and loads your app on a connected Android
    device or emulator.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd WhatShouldWeEat
  npm start

============ Adding npm packages =======
